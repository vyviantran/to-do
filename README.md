# to-do-list

This app will allow you to add and remove tasks, mark them as complete, and order them by priority and due date.

The to-do list will capture four elements of the task in an object:
    1. Name
    2. Due date
    3. Priority (low, medium, high)
    4. Is complete flag

There will be an input form or prompt that allows the user to add the first three attributes. Only the task name is mandatory.
The task list will order tasks by priority, then due date, then alphabetically by name. Completed tasks will pushed to the bottom.
Each task will have a checkbox to mark completion. Upon checking, the task will be crossed out and moved to the bottom.
