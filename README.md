# To-Do-EAVAC-Project

Team EAVAC consists of:
    1. Elizabeth Merrill
    2. Audra Barrella
    3. Vyvian Tran
    4. Alec Nicely
    5. Cole Bell
    6. Ryan Bowden

Team EAVAC will be creating a To-Do List web app. 

The App will allow you to add and remove tasks, mark them as complete, and order them by importance.

To-Do list will capture four elements of the task in an object:
    1. Task Name
    2. Task Due date
    3. Task importance (low, medium, high)

There will be an input form or prompt that allows the user to add each of these attributes
The task list will order the tasks based on the importance
there will be a button that will allow the user to mark an item complete, which will push it to the bottom of the list
